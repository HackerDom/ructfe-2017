This service does not store any flag by itself, it only serves as a coins wallet.
You can rather buy flags on BlackMarket after you steal coins from other team's smart contracts.

Check blockchain and find other team's smart contracts, which are regularly populated by checksystem with coins,
and try to steal that coins from them. If you manage to convince BlackMarket that you stole coins
from other team's contract, you'll be given team's flag(s).

NOTE that:
 * 'steal' means: withdraw more than you deposited
 * The steal should be a result of a single transaction rather than a result of complex set of your actions 
 * Your smart contract, which helps you steal coins, will be checked by BlackMarket according to this ABI:
   [{""constant"":true,""inputs"":[],""name"":""ownerIp"",""outputs"":[{""name"":"""",""type"":""uint32""}],""payable"":false,""stateMutability"":""view"",
   ""type"":""function""},{""payable"":true,""stateMutability"":""payable"",""type"":""fallback""}]{""payable"":true,""stateMutability"":""payable"",""type"":""fallback""}]

   -> so it should contain a public variable named 'ownerIp' with any packed ip-address from your team's subnet.
      'packed' means BlackMarket will unpack it with: new IPAddress(BitConverter.GetBytes(ownerIp)).ToString()

Use /checkTransaction?transaction=<STEALING_TRANSACTION_HASH>&contractAddr=<VICTIM_SMART_CONTRACT_ADDR>
on http://blackmarket.piratecoin.ructfe.org:14474 (which is http://10.10.10.101:14474) after you steal the coins.
